* [Personal Porfolio](http://kristyslade.weebly.com/)


I’m a Technical Writing and Instructional Design specialist, with over 15 years’ experience, as well as a master’s in Educational Technology. My interest is in enabling others to thrive at what they do by enhancing their learning ability.

I love developing either highly technical content or human-centric content. My areas of expertise are, among others, in product and software documentation, e-learning content development, and instructional video scripting, storyboarding, and development. Most recently I have been involved in creating instructional videos with the use of AI generated content.
